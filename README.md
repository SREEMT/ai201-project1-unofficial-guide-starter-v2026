# Unit 1

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences. Which corpus you picked, and the kinds of
     questions your system answers. Write it for someone who has never seen
     this repo.

     Milestone 5. -->
I picked the city_guides corpus, which contains guides about towns, transportation, food, accommodation, accessibility, and other travel information. The system retrieves relevant markdown sections from these guides and uses them to answer specific questions about the region. It is designed to give answers grounded in the documents rather than relying on outside information.

## Chunking Strategy

**Chunk size:** 700 Characters
**Overlap:** 0 Characters

<!-- What about YOUR documents made you pick these numbers? Short posts and
     long sectioned guides don't want the same chunking, and "800 seemed
     reasonable" earns nothing. Point at something you noticed when you read
     the documents in Milestone 1.

     If you changed your mind partway through, say so and say why. That's worth
     more than pretending you got it right first time.

     Milestone 3. -->
I chose a maximum of about 700 characters because the city guides are organized into sections with markdown headings such as "Getting there," "Getting around," and "Where to stay." I kept the heading with its related content and combined short sections so that chunks would contain enough context to answer questions on their own. I used no overlap because the sections already provide natural boundaries, so repeating text between chunks would add duplication without much benefit.

## Sample Chunks

<!-- Five chunks, pasted as text. Label each one and name the file it came from
     AND the function that produced it — the grader checks your code against
     what you claim here.

     `python app.py chunks -n 5` prints all three for you. Copy them straight
     across.

     Milestone 3. -->

**Chunk 1** — source: `guide_accessibility.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```

# Getting around the region with limited mobility

An honest assessment rather than a promotional one. Some of these places are
difficult and it is better to know in advance.
```

**Chunk 2** — source: `guide_corry_vale.md#1` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```

## Getting around

Nothing within the valley is walkable from anything else — the villages are two to four miles apart. There is one taxi, based in the largest village, and it must be booked a day ahead. Most visitors drive between villages and walk the footpaths in between.

## Eat and drink

One pub in the largest village serves food seven days a week. A second, in the third village, opensThursday to Sunday. There is a farm shop at the valley mouth that sells bread, cheese and little else, and it closes at 4pm. Bring supplies; this is not a place with options.
```

**Chunk 3** — source: `guide_givens_mill.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```

# Givens Mill

Givens Mill is a village of 700 built around a working watermill that still grinds flour commercially. It is the sort of place people visit for an afternoon and then talk about for longer than the visit lasted.

## Getting there

No station and no bus on Sundays; four buses a day from Brightwater on weekdays, taking 30 minutes.Driving is 20 minutes. The village car park holds about forty cars and is full by 11am on summer Saturdays.

## Getting around

Everything is on one street along the river. The mill is at one end and the church at the other, eight minutes apart. The riverside path continues in both directions for as far as you want to walk.
```

**Chunk 4** — source: `guide_marchwood.md#0` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```

# Marchwood

Marchwood is the regional hub — 180,000 people, the junction everyone changes trains at, and a citymost visitors pass through rather than stop in. That is a mistake, though an understandable one, since almost nothing of interest is near the station.

## Getting there

Every railway line in the region meets here, which is the city's defining feature. Trains to Brightwater run every 40 minutes until 11pm. The airport is 20 minutes out by a dedicated bus that runs every 15 minutes and costs more than the equivalent taxi shared between three people.
```

**Chunk 5** — source: `guide_regional_transport.md#3` — produced by: `chunker.py::split_documents`

```

## Walking and cycling

The river path from Brightwater runs four miles upstream on a good surface. The
old railway trackbed from Kestrelford runs six miles on an easy gradient and is
the best walking in the region for the effort involved. The coastal path from
Halden Bay is more serious — exposed, and closed in high wind.

Cycling is pleasant on the river path and the trackbed, and unpleasant on Mill
Road and the coast road, neither of which has a shoulder.

## Sample Answer

<!-- One complete question and answer, pasted as text, with the source line
     visible. Milestone 4. -->

**Question:**
What are Brightwater's Tuesday market hours?

**Answer:**

```
Brightwater's Tuesday market sets up at 7am in the square and is finished by 1pm.

```

**My relevance cutoff:** 0.65

<!-- The number you set in config.py, and how you got there.

     You ran five questions your corpus covers and the five in OUT_OF_SCOPE
     that it clearly doesn't, and wrote down the best distance for each. What
     did those two groups look like? Where was the gap? Put the actual numbers
     here — the table below wants all ten rows.

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. For each: what you asked for, what came back, and
     what you changed about it.

     "I asked Claude to write the chunking function from my notes. It ignored
     the overlap, so I added that myself" is the level of detail we're after.
     "I used AI to help me code" is not.

     Milestone 5. -->

**1.**
I didnt use claude for this since most of my AI usage was not really code. I used ChatGPT to help me clarify some aspects of the assignment and help format some markdown documentation.

It helped me out understand certain concepts better and also sped up documenting everything and formatting it the way I wanted it. Example would be the table above with the distance data for different questions

**2.**
I also used ChatGPT to help me fine tune my chunker. I actually have a worse version commented out. The one thats implemented was tweaked by ChatGPT to save some time. I just told it to help me make it chunk by markdown headers since my corpus uses markdown files with headers a lot.

It fixed my code and made it more robust than the original. After testing and reviewing the code, I decided to keep it for now. I feel like different chunking methods for different corpus's might be a feature I might add later.

# Unit 2

<!-- These sections get ADDED to what's already above. Don't delete or rewrite
     unit 1 — the point is that someone can see what you said before you knew
     how it went. -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Your five criteria, three runs each. `python run_eval.py --label before`
     runs the questions, puts the OUT_OF_SCOPE ones through the gate, and
     writes it all into results/ for you. Targets come from criteria.md; the
     verdict column is your call.

     Criterion 3 is measured in one deterministic pass rather than three, so
     the same number goes in all three run columns. That's correct, not lazy.

     Milestone 1. -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

<!-- Underneath, paste the REAL output for each criterion from one of your
     runs — the actual text your system produced, not a description of it.
     Name the file and function that produced it. -->

## Verdicts

<!-- MET or MISSED for each of the five, against the target you wrote last
     unit — not a new one. Plus a sentence on how you decided. That sentence
     matters most where it was close.

     If your target said 4 of 5 and your runs came out 4, 3, 4, that's a MISS.
     The target has to hold, not show up occasionally.

     Milestone 2. -->

| # | Criterion | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |

## Diagnoses

<!-- For each miss: which stage caused it, and how. The stage alone isn't
     enough — you need the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis: "Question 3 didn't work."
     A diagnosis:     "Question 3 asks about laundry costs. The answer is in
                       one sentence that got split across two chunks, so
                       neither chunk on its own contains it."

     The five stages: loading → chunking → embedding → retrieval → generation.

     Look for a pattern. If three misses all ask about numbers, that's one
     problem, not three.

     Missed nothing? Say so, then say honestly whether your targets were set
     low, and which one you'd tighten and to what.

     Milestone 3. -->

## The Improvement

**What I changed:**

**Why I picked it:**

<!-- Connect it to a specific diagnosis above in one sentence. If you can't,
     you picked a fix because it sounded impressive. -->

### Run Log — After

<!-- Same format, same five criteria, three runs each.
     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

| Criterion | Target | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Retrieved chunk contains the answer | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 2. Every answer names a source | 5 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 3. Gate stops out-of-corpus questions | 4 of 5 |  |  |  |  |
| 4. | | | | | |
| 5. | | | | | |

**Did it help?**

<!-- Say plainly whether it did, and how you know. If it made things worse,
     say that — a change that backfired, honestly reported, earns full credit
     and is more interesting than one that worked. What matters is that you can
     tell.

     Milestone 4. -->

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed after your fix: what you'd do about it,
     and why you stopped where you did.

     "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is left is
     not.

     Milestone 5. -->

## What I'd Do Differently

<!-- Knowing what you know now — which of your five criteria would you write
     differently, and why?

     Milestone 5. -->
